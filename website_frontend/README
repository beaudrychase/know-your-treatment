INSTRUCTIONS FOR SETTING UP SERVER

1. Install Nodejs (I installed Nodejs from tar.xz from Nodejs' website and it includes npm the js package manager)
2. cd into website_frontend directory and use npm install to install all dependencies needed for the server
3. use "npm run build" to compile all .jsx into run formats
4. use "npm run start" to create the webpack instance
5. by default, localhost:8080 should be able to access the website
