    <h2>Symptoms</h2>
    <p>The symptoms of HIV vary depending on the stage of infection. Though people living with HIV tend to be most infectious in the first few months, many are unaware of their status until later stages. The first few weeks after initial infection, individuals may experience no symptoms or an influenza-like illness including fever, headache, rash or sore throat.<br>
    As the infection progressively weakens the immune system, an individual can develop other signs and symptoms, such as swollen lymph nodes, weight loss, fever, diarrhoea and cough. Without treatment, they could also develop severe illnesses such as tuberculosis, cryptococcal meningitis, and cancers such as lymphomas and Kaposi's sarcoma, among others.<p>

    <h2>Treatment Overview</h2>
    <p>HIV can be suppressed by combination ART consisting of 3 or more ARV drugs. ART does not cure HIV infection but controls viral replication within a person's body and allows an individual's immune system to strengthen and regain the capacity to fight off infections.<br>
    In 2015, WHO released a new "Guideline on when to start antiretroviral therapy and on pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV.” The guidelines recommend that anyone infected with HIV should begin antiretroviral treatment as soon after diagnosis as possible.<br>
    By end-2015, 17.0 million people living with HIV were receiving ART globally which meant a global coverage of 46% (43–50%).<br>
    Based on WHO’s new recommendations, to treat all people living with HIV and offer antiretrovirals as an additional prevention choice for people at "substantial" risk, the number of people eligible for antiretroviral treatment increases from 28 million to all 36.7 million people. Expanding access to treatment is at the heart of a new set of targets for 2020 which aim to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030.</p>
